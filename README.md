# Kuri's XP-Pen Userland drivers

This repo currently houses a command-line only utility that creates a userspace driver for the following models:
- Artist 22R Pro

It initializes the supported tablets with their default bindings but the bindings can be changed by modifying the configuration file:
'$HOME/.local/share/xp_pen_userland/driver.cfg'

Things on the TODO list:
- Add binding support for 22R Pro dials
- Make a nice GUI to perform binding changes
- Support more XP-Pen devices
